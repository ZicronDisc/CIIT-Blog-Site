                                            <b>Have you ever wondered how we are positioned up there in space?</b> Most of us haven’t gone there because it is too expensive for us common people. But in your own observation, the time when the Sun or Moon
                                            rises from the sky, stars we can see day or night, what can you say about our location? <b>Nicolaus Copernicus</b>, <u>a historical astronomer and mathematician also
                                            known as the father of modern astronomy</u>. He proposed that the universe is organized in a
                                            <b><i>heliocentric system</i></b>. This setup tells us that the <i>Sun is at the center while the planets including
                                            Earth revolve around it</i>. Addition to that the only celestial body that orbits around Earth is our Moon. Can we guarantee that this model is reliable on how we are positioned in space?

                                        </p>
                                        <p>

                                            Copernicus has a theory that opposed the Geocentric model (Earth centered system) of Ptolemy. He claimed that our universe is organized in a heliocentric system. Where <b>helio</b> means <i>Sun</i> and <b>centric</b>                                            means <i>center</i>. It describes that the Sun is at the center which is stationary, the planets orbits around it in a perfect circular form, and having their own axis. But if we pertain only to Earth, we can
                                            see that it revolves in a tilt position, he concluded that because of this we are able to experience seasons through the year (Cavanaugh, 2018, p.2). The Sun centered model made a big impact on astronomy that
                                            leads to our growing knowledge about the universe since it opposed those models who proposed that Earth is the center of all.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Even though this theory has a point in the organization of our universe, it still has flaws by explaining some concepts about astronomy. One of these is the <b>parallax of the star</b>.
                                            <u>tells us the displacement of a star in the observer view</u>. To apply, we all know that Earth is revolving around the Sun by its own axis. Copernicus can’t seem to accurately explain the parallax of the
                                            stars when we are observing the sky here on Earth (Palma, 2020) by applying it with his model named “Copernican Heliocentric Model”. With that flaw, a lot of astronomers did not accept his theory. They concluded
                                            Ptolemy’s “Geocentric” Model is more acceptable due to more reasonable and precise explanations he stated than his.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Few years later the Copernican model gained supporters and of them is <b>Galileo Galilei</b>. He used the power of the <i>telescope</i> to support the model. Using the invention, he discovered facts about Venus
                                            and Jupiter. In <b>Venus</b>, he observed that it has <u>phases of illumination</u> whenever it orbits the Sun (Shu, 2020) and in <b>Jupiter’s moon</b> it also proves the only <u>celestial body 
                                            that orbits a planet is moon</u> (History.com, 2019). Due to his propounding support for the model, he was house arrested by the church due to religious issues (Shu, 2020). The Copernican model received a lot
                                            of support from some astronomers who made thorough observations to some neighboring planets. Because of this, it made new realizations on how the solar system is organized in space. Galileo Galilei and some
                                            astronomers didn’t give up to study more about our universe.

                                            <b>Heliocentrism</b>, <u>a model which states that the Sun is at the center</u> which is stationary while the planets revolve around it, and the moon is the only celestial body that orbits around a planet. This
                                            model has a tough time in the process of acceptance. It has flaws that caused many to disapprove. Due to propounding support of other astronomers to resolve the flaws, slowly the model is being accepted by many
                                            and made the modern representation of the universe we have today.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The Stonehenge and the Pyramids. They are known for their tourist attractions and for their civilizations, but one thing that other people notices about these three is that their attractions and civilizations are also related to astronomy.
                                        </p>

                                            The Stonehenge, one of the mysterious structures in the world and is wildly a famous tourist attraction. Many tourists visit the Stonehenge each year to take a glimpse of the mysterious stone and its alignment. The Stonehenge was built from about 2500
                                            BC and it is carefully aligned to line up with the movements of the sun. If you were to stand in the middle of the stone circle on midsummer’s day, the sun rises just to the left of the Heel Stone, an outlying
                                            stone to the north-east of the monument. Marking the movements of the sun was an important to the people who built the Stonehenge. However, there is little evidence to what is the real reason behind the stone’s
                                            creation. It may also be a calendar to know the changing of seasons, because the seasons would tell what time is best to plant their crops, what will be time for the crops to grow and when is the time that is
                                            not for planting crops.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The Pyramid, also a mysterious structure in the world, and is also a famous tourist attraction, but it’s creation to some are still unclear. The Pyramids was built from 2550 to 2490 BC, and it’s three largest pyramids are said to represent the three stars
                                            in the belt of Orion and more about the constellations.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Astronomy was widely used by the prehistoric people. They made a structure to see the sun rise and looked at the sky to tell the time. Astronomy has made an impact to the way they lived and helped them in their lives.

                                            <i>oxygen production</i> and <i>cleaning our filthy air</i>. During this pandemic a lot of us are at home, getting bored, and exhausted about online activities. Because of that, a lot of us made new hobbies
                                            for our everyday lives. Some became home chefs, graphic designers, streamers, and artists. I am one of them, but in the field of <b>gardening</b>. Today, I am going to share my journey in being a green thumb
                                            during this quarantine. This will not only <u>help our environment, but also
                                            our psychological and physical health</u>. Additionally, this kind of activity will help us to be committed, patient, responsible and confident. Without anything else, are you down for this activity?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            First things first we can’t start if we haven’t gathered the right <b>materials</b> we need. For this to be acquired we need online shopping or just our own creativity (DIY). With that it is essential to have
                                            <b>proper pots or containers</b>, <b>soil</b>, <b>seed of your choice</b>, and a <b>watering can</b>. Afterwards, gather all of it and prepare yourself in the right place to properly and organize your materials
                                            to officially start the activity.

                                        <p>
                                            After all the preparation, the next thing to do is planting the seed of your choice. You need to get your <b>pot or container and fill the right amount of soil</b>. Afterwards, put a <b>hole</b> in the middle,
                                            but <i>not too deep and not too shallow </i>and then put the seed in the hole. For <b>smaller
                                            seeds</b> (e.g., tomato, bokchoy, eggplant, and, bell pepper) put at least <i>3-5 pieces</i> and for <b>large
                                            seeds</b> (e.g., sunflower, corn, nuts, peas, and calamansi) put at <i>least 1-2 pieces</i> hence this will be our probability that not all of it will grow, then cover it with the topsoil. When you finish the
                                            task, <b>water</b> it in a right amount and please be careful of flooding it because this might cause rotting. In the end, if you prefer to put tags, feel free to do this so that it will help you remember what
                                            you have planted.

                                        <p>
                                            The next thing you need to do is put it in the pot where it may get a proper amount of
                                            <b>light</b> <u>for the seed to have a full growth</u>. Some of them may need <b>direct sunlight</b>, <b>slightly shaded</b>,
                                            <b>fully shaded</b>, and <b>indoors</b>. Please see it in your seed packet on what kind of light it requires. This will be the last catalyst to make your seeds grow. But remember don’t let them dry out, to avoid
                                            this always keep them moist by using water spray.

                                            Since we fully started our planting expedition all we need to do is our <b>commitment</b>,
                                            <b>patience</b>, <b>responsibility</b>, and <b>confidence</b> <i>in handling your plant</i>. Always take care of your plant and be mindful of all your actions to make your journey successful and become one of
                                            your greatest achievements. This kind of activity will make us learn many things to improve our personality as a student, teacher, family member, and co-workers.

                                            When your plant is fully grown and standing still in the environment, put either natural or artificial <b>fertilizers</b> to make the plant gather more nutrients, especially during the growing season to make
                                            them healthier. Lastly, all you need is just to have fun taking care of your new plant.

With that, just take care of it and you’ll be successful in your journey. <b><i>When you fail, don't give up, planting is just like

                                            I am currently in the Programming Track, and this is what I have learned so far. In the Programming Track, you will learn different types of programming language. You will also do projects with the programming languages that you have learned. At first,
                                            I thought programming was hard, but when I learned further, I only thought that it was hard. I also know a little about animation. I often research how to animate and watch processes of animating. I am also
                                            fascinating how animating works and I also wanted to learn how to animate. In the Multimedia and Visual Arts Strand, I think they will learn about drawing, color theory and about the layout of their drawing.
                                        </p>

                                            In the Programming Track, you will learn about a programming language, and how to use it. As I said earlier, you will also do projects with the programming language that you have learned. The process of inputting the code is easy, but remembering the
                                            functions of the code is hard. But programming is not about remembering each of the functions. You can also search for the functions online. I don’t know what they are doing the Animation Track, but I think
                                            they are doing something similar to cartoons or anime. I think the process of animating is that they draw first the scenes on a piece of papers, and then draw it on the computer screen. In the Multimedia and
                                            Visual Arts Strand, I think what they do is that they are drawing and learning more about drawing like the strokes and the proper coloring of the drawing, or the proper lining in some parts of the drawing.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In the Programming Track, we have subjects like Computer Programming. In Computer Programming, we are thought of a programming language, and then do projects with it. We also have a subject called Web Design and Scripting. In Web Design, we are also thought
                                            of a programming language and then make projects with it. The difference is that, Web Design focuses more on websites, and the languages that I have learned in Web Design are mostly about Web Designing. In the
                                            Animation Track, they are learning 2D Animation, which is I think the movement of illustrations or the drawings that they have drawn. They are also learning about 3D Modeling, which is I think a representation
                                            of an object in 3D. In the Multimedia and Visual Arts Strand, they have a subject dedicated to drawing. I guess what they do in that subject is that they learn more about drawing and the elements of drawing.
                                        </p>

                                            As you can see, both tracks are interesting to learn. They have interesting subjects that can make you better in what track you are in. Being in the Programming Track, I’ll say that programming is easy to learn. But I also find Animation interesting to
                                            learn.
