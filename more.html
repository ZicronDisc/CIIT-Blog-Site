                                    about our location? <b>Nicolaus Copernicus</b>, <u>a historical astronomer and mathematician also
                                    known as the father of modern astronomy</u>. He proposed that the universe is organized in a
                                    <b><i>heliocentric system</i></b>. This setup tells us that the <i>Sun is at the center while the planets including
                                    Earth revolve around it</i>. Addition to that the only celestial body that orbits around Earth is our
                                    Moon. Can we guarantee that this model is reliable on how we are positioned in space?

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Copernicus has a theory that opposed the Geocentric model (Earth centered system) of
                                    Ptolemy. He claimed that our universe is organized in a heliocentric system. Where <b>helio</b> 
                                    means <i>Sun</i> and <b>centric</b> means <i>center</i>. It describes that the Sun is at the center which is stationary, the
                                    planets orbits around it in a perfect circular form, and having their own axis. But if we pertain
                                    only to Earth, we can see that it revolves in a tilt position, he concluded that because of this we
                                    are able to experience seasons through the year (Cavanaugh, 2018, p.2). The Sun centered
                                    model made a big impact on astronomy that leads to our growing knowledge about the
                                    universe since it opposed those models who proposed that Earth is the center of all.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even though this theory has a point in the organization of our universe, it still has flaws
                                    by explaining some concepts about astronomy. One of these is the <b>parallax of the star</b>. 
                                    <u>tells us the displacement of a star in the observer view</u>. To apply, we all know that Earth is revolving
                                    around the Sun by its own axis. Copernicus can’t seem to accurately explain the parallax of the
                                    stars when we are observing the sky here on Earth (Palma, 2020) by applying it with his model
                                    named “Copernican Heliocentric Model”. With that flaw, a lot of astronomers did not accept his
                                    theory. They concluded Ptolemy’s “Geocentric” Model is more acceptable due to more
                                    reasonable and precise explanations he stated than his.

                                <p>
                                    Few years later the Copernican model gained supporters and of them is <b>Galileo Galilei</b>.
                                    He used the power of the <i>telescope</i> to support the model. Using the invention, he discovered
                                    facts about Venus and Jupiter. In <b>Venus</b>, he observed that it has <u>phases of illumination</u>
                                    whenever it orbits the Sun (Shu, 2020) and in <b>Jupiter’s moon</b> it also proves the only <u>celestial body 
                                    that orbits a planet is moon</u> (History.com, 2019). Due to his propounding support for the
                                    model, he was house arrested by the church due to religious issues (Shu, 2020). The Copernican
                                    model received a lot of support from some astronomers who made thorough observations to
                                    some neighboring planets. Because of this, it made new realizations on how the solar system is
                                    organized in space. Galileo Galilei and some astronomers didn’t give up to study more about
                                    our universe.

                                    <b>Heliocentrism</b>, <u>a model which states that the Sun is at the center</u> which is stationary
                                    while the planets revolve around it, and the moon is the only celestial body that orbits around a
                                    planet. This model has a tough time in the process of acceptance. It has flaws that caused many
                                    to disapprove. Due to propounding support of other astronomers to resolve the flaws, slowly
                                    the model is being accepted by many and made the modern representation of the universe we
                                    have today.

                                    The Stonehenge, one of the mysterious structures in the world and is wildly a famous tourist attraction. Many tourists visit the Stonehenge each year to take a glimpse of the mysterious stone and its alignment. The Stonehenge was built from about 2500

                                    the north-east of the monument. Marking the movements of the sun was an important to the people who built the Stonehenge. However, there is little evidence to what is the real reason behind the stone’s creation. It may
                                    also be a calendar to know the changing of seasons, because the seasons would tell what time is best to plant their crops, what will be time for the crops to grow and when is the time that is not for planting crops.

                                    The Pyramid, also a mysterious structure in the world, and is also a famous tourist attraction, but it’s creation to some are still unclear. The Pyramids was built from 2550 to 2490 BC, and it’s three largest pyramids are said to represent the three stars
                                    in the belt of Orion and more about the constellations.

                                    Astronomy was widely used by the prehistoric people. They made a structure to see the sun rise and looked at the sky to tell the time. Astronomy has made an impact to the way they lived and helped them in their lives.

                                achieving our dreams could be <i>hard as a rock, and as if we climb a steep mountain to reach the top</i>. But
                                only you can complete every challenge you take in your life. <b>Strong commitment, passion, and confidence</b>,
                                these characteristics will make every dream possible. Even when stumble the steep mountain, you will

                                Dreaming is one of our rights as a human, we must work and strive harder for us to reach the countless

                                <b>Eiryk</b>, <u>a student in CIIT SHS</u> has 3 brothers. One of them is actually his twin. Although they do this
                                occasionally, their great bond is playing together and sharing experiences in life. Eiryk has lot of hobbies
                                and to name a few, <b>sleeping</b>, <b>watching anime</b> (e.g., Naruto Shippuden, Death Note, Jujutsu Kaisen and
                                Attack on Titan), <b>reading manga</b> (e.g., Chainsaw Man, Jujutsu Kaisen, Attack on Titan and Fire Punch),
                                Playing interesting <b>games</b> either offline or online games (e.g., Call of Duty or Mobile Legend), and learning
                                about <b>programming with languages</b> such as HTML, CSS, a little bit of JavaScript, Python and C++ which he
                                already completed through online courses. He studied a lot of programming languages comparable to
                                the studies of the human language (e.g., Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Latin, etc.). The only difference is
                                that these <i>programming languages or the series of codes is being translated to computer language.</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before, Eiryk thought of being an <b>athlete</b> in the future because he really likes <i>basketball and
                                soccer</i>. Eventually, he decided not to because it is <u>not his literal dream for his career</u>. He starts to research
                                about programming and he became more and more curious about it and this eventually became his first
                                real dream. He specifically wanted to be a web designer. Thus, to further pursue his dream, he took the
                                programming track entrance exams from different colleges and eventually was accepted at <b>CIIT</b>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Eiryk mentioned that according to his <b>father,</b> <i>being a programmer would gain a lot of monetary
                                value most especially abroad</i> and this made him more eager to pursue the programming course. He
                                strived by practicing at home and by teaching his twin who likes being a web designer & little brother as 
                                a game developer. Now, he sees himself in future that he will be a responsible and hardworking
                                programmer that will help his family. With this, he made a motto, <i>“Errors are part of the process”</i>. The
                                eagerness of him enabled his confidence to take the path and made multiple growth that will surely make
                                his dreams come true.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pursuing your dream is the biggest challenge in your life. It will eventually become your <b>biggest
                                achievement</b> when the time comes. All you need to do is work, work, and work, just like Eiryk. By the
                                means of <i>researching, studying, and seeking motivation from others</i>; he gains much more positivity in
                                pursuing what he started. With that, let’s apply it to our lives that we must have to work with passion to
                                make your dreams into reality. As a parting message, I would just say that <b><i>dream do come true you just
                                need to work hard for it.</i></b>

                                        His first dream is to be a doctor because he wants to help people to be healthy and actually doing surgeries. In elementary, he wanted to be an architect and engineer. It was at that time when he was 11 to 12 years of age, that he used to play Minecraft
                                        and made him more interested in doing stuffs like drawing a 3D building, designing and etc. Entered JHS, he had a few career options; to be a doctor, an architect, an engineer or a programmer. He did not know what he wanted
                                        to choose, but after graduating, he finally chose what he wanted to do and it was programming. He was inspired by many developers out there and he wanted to help them in innovating to make the world better.

                                        if possible, in the future, thus making him undecided.

                                The current pandemic really changed the society, and most of us are still adapting to it. 
                                In education, we transitioned from face-to-face to internet-based interaction. 
                                The quarantine had its anniversary last March in the Philippines. May I ask you a 
                                question, what kind of online student developed on you today? This will let us know what 
                                are the effects in being an online society. Did it make a good impact or not?

                                    The current pandemic really changed the society, and most of us are still adapting to it. In
                                    education, we transitioned from <b>face-to-face to internet-based interaction</b>. The quarantine had its
                                    anniversary last March in the Philippines. May I ask you a question, <b>what kind of online student 
                                    developed on you today?</b> This will let us know what are the effects in being an online society. Did
                                    it make a good impact or not? Some might say it is good because of convenience and some may
                                    decline due to its effects on our psychological health. What would be the advantage of this new
                                    environment? Will it be worth it in this kind of situation?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We can categorize online students in different ways. Firstly, we call it the <b>Initiative
                                    Speaker</b>. Every teacher ends every session with questions like do you have any clarifications?
                                    Any questions? Did you understand? These are some common questions ever since we entered
                                    school. This will test our initiative to ask or tell something to anyone we know. According to English
                                    dictionary, it is the power or opportunity to act or take charge before others do. To classify it, these
                                    are the <u>students who confidently ask or tell somebody about a topic you either understand or not</u>.
                                    Asking questions and telling something is not a bad thing it will make you more knowledgeable
                                    and will enhance your vocabulary skills that will help you in the future.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Technology is all around us, question you are you a tech savvy? According to millennials,
                                    these are the people who are used towards technology. Even though you are that professional in
                                    using these, I doubt that you can manage it without any mistakes. We call students who usually
                                    have slight or big problems in technology as <b>Accident Prone</b>. They are those <u>people who
                                    sometimes have intermittent connections, typographical errors, accidentally exiting tabs, inputting
                                    wrong messages (wrong send), and etc</u>. Mistakes are always a part of our journey; without it we
                                    can’t improve ourselves. We must learn from it not avoid it, because one day these mistakes may
                                    lead you to a better tomorrow.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Having a schedule may be a hard one to some. Others usually prefer an irregular one
                                    since they hold their own time. In some way, it may be fine as long as you can handle the
                                    consequences of it. We call these students as <b>Free Behind Bars</b> that classify <u>students who do 
                                    their assignments anytime they want, it may be earlier, later, or not at all</u>. One major factor to this
                                    is online school, where everyone just feel they are really just at home so they can do anything
                                    what they want from just sleeping, eat, take a leisure, and etc. But this may be bad for us,
                                    especially for our psychological health. We need a proper way to manage our time to enhance
                                    our brain coordination every day.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With the connection of Free Behind Bars category, do you usually do things almost or past
                                    midnight? If yes then you are included on what we call <b>Powerful Nocturnal</b>. Powerful, we hear a
                                    lot of it from our superheroes like Hulk, Captain America, Spiderman, and more. For Free Behind
                                    the Bars this is not the case of being “Powerful”. <u>They are the people who would do their task at
                                    almost 11:59 or usually past midnight and comply it at that span time</u>. This is a bad kind of time
                                    management it will affect your physical and psychological health. According to some experts,
                                    having a nice and complete sleep can make your tomorrow happy and positive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The pandemic and online setting is really hard that almost all of us are burnt out. Have
                                    you ever done to the point of not complying requirements, and not talking to anyone? Then, you
                                    might be classified as <b>Wandering Ghost</b>. These are the <u>students who sometimes do not pass their
                                    requirements and having a hard communicating to their teachers</u>. Giving up may be a part of your
                                    journey, but if you continue this it is not good. How will you improve for your future? You need to
                                    rise and walk through your path to make all your achievements.

                                <p>
                                    If these categories do not include you, we could classify you as the <b>On Path</b>. This is not
                                    fully perfect kind of student. <u>They only have the capability in trying to manage their lives</u>. In
                                    downfall it may be hard, but they will not try to give up and still walk the talk in their lives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Any kind of management in your life will affect your psychological and physical health
                                    which may be a good one or not</b>. If you found out the you are either an Initiative Speaker, Accident
                                    Prone, Free Behind Bars, Powerful Nocturnal, Wandering Ghost, or On Path. Then ask yourself
                                    is this good for me? Afterwards, make a change to make your path wholesome. Students are still
                                    learning, taking any opportunities beyond their path that will create their own growth. To make a
                                    change, just be positive and always walk the talk. As your words to live by according to <b>Leo

                                            Since classes are online, our personalities may have changed, or not. In our own way, we are different type of students. But what about online? We may still be different from when we were doing classes physically, or we may also be the same before. Here
                                            are some of the different types of students.

These are the type of students who is not afraid to speak and is usually the one who answers the teacher’s question. They are also the type of students who is not hesitant to ask questions
                                            or to tell something to his or her classmates, teacher, or to their friend.

                                            The last type of student we have is the On Path student. These are the type of students that is studying hard or is doing their best to their assignments and is the type of student that is trying their hard to manage and stay on their paths to where they
                                            believe, will bring them to success.

                                            These are some of the type of online student. There are more types of online student, but for now, these are only some examples. Which type of online student are you? Are you the On Path student? Or the Wandering Ghost type? Or maybe both?

                                    MVA, Animation, and Programming courses can take multimedia courses however in programming you
                                    will be focusing more on computing which is about gaming. Also, in choosing a job, App Design can be
                                    for both Programming (coding and GUI making), and MVA (design conceptualization). Furthermore, Web
                                    Designing can also be from Programming (scripting and GUI making), and Animation (conceptualization
                                    of dynamic website) courses. Every strand is really unique and surprisingly beautiful to each other.

                                    answered by yourself while you are in the journey of your chosen track. To make you assured that it is
                                    certainly the right track, you need to consider this (1) <b>Do you love it?</b> (2)<b>Does it make you feel happy
                                    and better?</b> MVA, Animation, Computer Programming is truly different among each other from
                                    specialized subjects, college degrees, and for job internships (additionally, dictated above there will be
                                    more college courses and jobs to choose). Moreover, any of these tracks will help you mold your future.
                                    As we part, <b><i>just believe on what you decided and just go on until you became one of your dreams</i></b>.

                                        To choose a strand or track is hard and tricky, especially if you don’t know what to choose. If you want to know more about CIIT’s strand and track, here are some comparison among the Animation Track, Programming Track and Arts and Design Strand.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I am currently in the Programming Track, and this is what I have learned so far. In the Programming Track, you will learn different types of programming language. You will also do projects with the programming languages that you have learned. At first,
                                        I thought programming was hard, but when I learned further, I only thought that it was hard. I also know a little about animation. I often research how to animate and watch processes of animating. I am also fascinating
                                        how animating works and I also wanted to learn how to animate. In the Multimedia and Visual Arts Strand, I think they will learn about drawing, color theory and about the layout of their drawing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the Programming Track, you will learn about a programming language, and how to use it. As I said earlier, you will also do projects with the programming language that you have learned. The process of inputting the code is easy, but remembering the
                                        functions of the code is hard. But programming is not about remembering each of the functions. You can also search for the functions online. I don’t know what they are doing the Animation Track, but I think they are doing
                                        something similar to cartoons or anime. I think the process of animating is that they draw first the scenes on a piece of papers, and then draw it on the computer screen. In the Multimedia and Visual Arts Strand, I think
                                        what they do is that they are drawing and learning more about drawing like the strokes and the proper coloring of the drawing, or the proper lining in some parts of the drawing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the Programming Track, we have subjects like Computer Programming. In Computer Programming, we are thought of a programming language, and then do projects with it. We also have a subject called Web Design and Scripting. In Web Design, we are also thought
                                        of a programming language and then make projects with it. The difference is that, Web Design focuses more on websites, and the languages that I have learned in Web Design are mostly about Web Designing. In the Animation
                                        Track, they are learning 2D Animation, which is I think the movement of illustrations or the drawings that they have drawn. They are also learning about 3D Modeling, which is I think a representation of an object in 3D.
                                        In the Multimedia and Visual Arts Strand, they have a subject dedicated to drawing. I guess what they do in that subject is that they learn more about drawing and the elements of drawing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As you can see, both tracks are interesting to learn. They have interesting subjects that can make you better in what track you are in. Being in the Programming Track, I’ll say that programming is easy to learn. But I also find Animation interesting to
                                        learn.
                                    </p>

                                We all know, that dreaming is as easy as a piece of cake.  We all have been dreaming

                                    <b>Saving the world just by planting?</b> Yes, it does help our environment especially for
                                    <i>oxygen production</i> and <i>cleaning our filthy air</i>. During this pandemic a lot of us are at home,
                                    getting bored, and exhausted about online activities. Because of that, a lot of us made new
                                    hobbies for our everyday lives. Some became home chefs, graphic designers, streamers, and
                                    artists. I am one of them, but in the field of <b>gardening</b>. Today, I am going to share my journey in
                                    being a green thumb during this quarantine. This will not only <u>help our environment, but also
                                    our psychological and physical health</u>. Additionally, this kind of activity will help us to be
                                    committed, patient, responsible and confident. Without anything else, are you down for this
                                    activity?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    First things first we can’t start if we haven’t gathered the right <b>materials</b> we need. For
                                    this to be acquired we need online shopping or just our own creativity (DIY). With that it is
                                    essential to have <b>proper pots or containers</b>, <b>soil</b>, <b>seed of your choice</b>, and a <b>watering can</b>.
                                    Afterwards, gather all of it and prepare yourself in the right place to properly and organize your
                                    materials to officially start the activity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After all the preparation, the next thing to do is planting the seed of your choice. You
                                    need to get your <b>pot or container and fill the right amount of soil</b>. Afterwards, put a <b>hole</b> in the
                                    middle, but <i>not too deep and not too shallow </i>and then put the seed in the hole. For <b>smaller
                                    seeds</b> (e.g., tomato, bokchoy, eggplant, and, bell pepper) put at least <i>3-5 pieces</i> and for <b>large
                                    seeds</b> (e.g., sunflower, corn, nuts, peas, and calamansi) put at <i>least 1-2 pieces</i> hence this will be
                                    our probability that not all of it will grow, then cover it with the topsoil. When you finish the
                                    task, <b>water</b> it in a right amount and please be careful of flooding it because this might cause
                                    rotting. In the end, if you prefer to put tags, feel free to do this so that it will help you
                                    remember what you have planted.
                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The next thing you need to do is put it in the pot where it may get a proper amount of
                                    <b>light</b> <u>for the seed to have a full growth</u>. Some of them may need <b>direct sunlight</b>, <b>slightly shaded</b>,
                                    <b>fully shaded</b>, and <b>indoors</b>. Please see it in your seed packet on what kind of light it requires. This
                                    will be the last catalyst to make your seeds grow. But remember don’t let them dry out, to
                                    avoid this always keep them moist by using water spray.
                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since we fully started our planting expedition all we need to do is our <b>commitment</b>,
                                    <b>patience</b>, <b>responsibility</b>, and <b>confidence</b> <i>in handling your plant</i>. Always take care of your plant
                                    and be mindful of all your actions to make your journey successful and become one of your
                                    greatest achievements. This kind of activity will make us learn many things to improve our
                                    personality as a student, teacher, family member, and co-workers. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When your plant is fully grown and standing still in the environment, put either natural
                                    or artificial <b>fertilizers</b> to make the plant gather more nutrients, especially during the growing
                                    season to make them healthier. Lastly, all you need is just to have fun taking care of your new
                                    plant.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Pandemic really struck us especially towards our physical and psychological health. From
                                    my experience, it made me happier and positive towards everyday life. With that, just take care
                                    of it and you’ll be successful in your journey. <b><i>When you fail, don't give up, planting is just like
                                    experimenting with food, chemicals, and programming. Try and try again, learn about it, and be
                                    confident that you will seek success.</i></b>

                                        The first step is to know what type of programmer you want to be. For example, to be a Web Designer or a Game Developer. Knowing what type of programmer you want is needed for the second step. This does not limit to what you want to be thought. If you
                                        want to be a Web Designer, and at the same time, a Game Developer, you can do so.

                                    <p>
                                        The next step is to know what type of programming languages your type of programmer is studying or learning. For example, if you are a Web Designer, then the mostly used programming languages used are: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. If you are a Game Developer,
                                        the most famous programming languages used in Game Developing are: Java, C++ and C#. Note that not because you have a certain type of programming course, does not mean you can’t learn other programming languages.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The next step is to study the programming languages. There are a lot of websites or app that you can use to learn programming. SoloLearn and freeCodeCamp are few examples of these apps and websites. You can also ask someone you know who is a programmer
                                        to teach you programming. Please make sure that the app or website is known or correct about their lessons in programming. There are some apps or websites that are teaching false lessons about programming and programming
                                        languages.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The next step is to understand what you are studying. It is like the old saying, if it came from the other ear, then it will go out the other ear. Don’t be like that. Don’t also think that programming is hard. It’s only hard if you think it’s hard. Everyone
                                        can learn programming. If you cannot understand what you have put inside your code, you need to understand how some of its code works and what their functions are.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The next step is to try and execute what you have learn. There are also many apps and websites that you can use for executing or inputting codes. Visual Studio Code and Brackets are example of these apps and websites. It’s like the saying but my own version.
                                        Practice makes understand how what you are doing works. But there are also times where you will fail. Do not give up, failure is part of the path to success. I also had mistakes when I am new to programing. That’s because
                                        I did not understand every part of it. But I did not give up because of one failure. I’m the type that gives up easily, but in programming, I try my best because this is my dream career.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These are the steps on how to become a programmer, but you can find more about being a programmer online. I am also starting new in programming, and there are times where I can’t understand what I have put inside my code. My tip is never give up, even
                                        when you don’t understand anything. After all, you’re the one who choose to study programming. Good luck studying.
